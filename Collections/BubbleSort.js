// The bubble sort method starts at the beginning of an unsorted array and 'bubbles up' unsorted values towards the end, 
// iterating through the array until it is completely sorted. It does this by comparing adjacent items and swapping them if they are out 
// of order. The method continues looping through the array until no swaps occur at which point the array is sorted.

// Instructions: Write a function bubbleSort which takes an array of integers as input and returns an array of these integers in sorted 
// order from least to greatest.

// Instructions: Starting from the beginning of the list, compare every adjacent pair, swap their position if they are not in the right 
// order (the latter one is smaller than the former one). After each iteration, one less element (the last one) is needed to be compared 
// until there are no more elements left to be compared.
