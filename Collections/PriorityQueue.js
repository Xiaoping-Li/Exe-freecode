// A Priority Queue is a special type of Queue in which items may have additional information which specifies their priority. 
// This could be simply represented with an integer. Item priority will override placement order in determining the sequence items are 
// dequeued. If an item with a higher priority is enqueued after items with lower priority, the higher priority item will be dequeued 
// before all the others.
