// Maps are data structures that store key-value pairs. In JavaScript, these are available to us as objects. Maps provide rapid lookup of 
// stored items based on key values and are very common and useful data structures.

// The new version of JavaScript provides us with a built-in Map object. This Map object, although similar to regular JavaScript objects, 
// provides some useful functionality that normal objects lack. For example, an ES6 Map tracks the insertion order of items that are added 
// to it. Here is a more complete overview of its methods:

// .has(key) returns true or false based on the presence of a key

// .get(key) returns the value associated with a key

// .set(key, value) sets a new key, value pair

// .delete(key) removes a key, value pair

// .clear() removes all key, value pairs

// .entries() returns an array of all the keys in insertion order

// .values() returns an array of all the values in insertion order
