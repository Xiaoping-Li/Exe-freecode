A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, called 'nodes', each of which points to the next. Each node in a linked list contains two key pieces of information: the `element` itself, and a reference to the `next` node.

Every _linked list_ should start out with a few basic properties: a `head` (the first item in your list) and a `length` (number of items in your list). Sometimes you'll see implementations of linked lists that incorporate a `tail` for the last element of the list, Whenever we add an element to the linked list, our length property should be incremented by one.
